In order to solve the problem of mushroom image classification and achieve the rapid identification of wild mushroom toxicity, a deep learning-based method for mushroom image classification is proposed using seven kinds of mushrooms as the research objects. The proposed classification method uses the pixel information of the images for feature extraction, taking into account the characteristics of natural scene images, and the extracted feature vectors are discriminative, independent and robust; the lightweight ShuffleNetV2 model has higher accuracy compared with other commonly used CNN models. Experiments show that the mushroom classification model based on ShuffleNetV2 has a Top-1 accuracy of 55.18% and a Top-5 accuracy of 93.55%, which can solve the problem of difficult classification of mushroom images to some extent. In the future, combined with mobile devices and embedded development, it will be able to be used for automatic classification of wild mushrooms in the natural environment, providing new ideas for the intelligence and automation of the mushroom industry.

Molecular and morphological characters, as important parts of biological taxonomy, are contradictory but need to be integrated. Organism's image recognition and bioinformatics are emerging and hot problems nowadays but with a gap between them. In this work, a multi-branching recognition framework mediated by genetic information bridges this barrier, which establishes the link between macro-morphology and micro-molecular information of mushrooms. The novel multi-perspective structure is proposed to fuse the feature images from three branching models, which significantly improves the accuracy of recognition by about 10% and up to more than 90%. Further, genetic information is implemented to the mushroom image recognition task by using genetic distance embeddings as the representation space for predicting image distance and species identification. Semantic overfitting of traditional classification tasks and the granularity of fine-grained image recognition are also discussed in depth for the first time. The generalizability of the model was investigated in fine-grained scenarios using zero-shot learning tasks, which could predict the taxonomic and evolutionary information of unseen samples. We presented the first method to map images to DNA, namely used an encoder mapping image to genetic distances, and then decoded DNA through a pre-trained decoder, where the total test accuracy on 37 species for DNA prediction is 87.45%. This study creates a novel recognition framework by systematically studying the mushroom image recognition problem, bridging the gap between macroscopic biological information and microscopic molecular information, which will provide a new reference for intelligent biometrics in the future.

Macro-fungi, usually called mushrooms, play a significant role in the ecosystem and share ubiquitous ecological niches in nature for their huge populations of over a million species. However, traditional classification approaches for mushrooms required professional taxonomic knowledge, and thus significant financial investment hinders its development with only ca. 20,000 species found now and only general applications employed such as poisonous mushroom identification. In this study, we creatively proposed an approach for automatic mushroom image recognition based on a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN). Attention mechanisms were combined with an efficient lightweight MobileNetV3 backbone network to achieve high performance on the mushroom image classification task. Our models achieve the highest 81.92% test accuracy on the public mushroom image dataset and 70.73% test accuracy on the local mushroom image dataset. Moreover, self-attention-based transformers are compared with lightweight DCNNs implementing attention mechanisms but do not achieve satisfying performance either on public or local datasets, which highlights the advantages of DCNNs for fine-grained biological image recognition. The proposed approach has demonstrated great potential for real-time and automatic mushroom image processing and the proposed automatic procedure will be complementary and a useful reference to traditional mushroom classification.KeywordsMushroom image identificationDeep convolutional neural networkAttention mechanism
